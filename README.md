# A Look into How Urbanization Might Influence Global Marriage Trends

## Topic Change
This project originally focused on the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep quality. However, I had to change the topic because the datasets couldnâ€™t be merged or enriched effectively.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to examine whether countries with higher levels of urbanization tend to have lower marriage rates, and what other factors might be influencing that relationship.

## Motivation
Sleep plays a cruical role in both our physical and mental health, yet people struggle a lot with poor sleep quality affecting their day to day life. Busy lifestyles, poor habits, and stress often interfere with sleep, leaving individuals feeling drained and unfocused. Factors like stress, inconsistent routines, and environmental conditions like screen time can significantly impact sleep health. In this project I will be analyzing lifestyle behaviors such as caffeine intake, exercise habits, and screen time affect sleep quality. The goal is to spot useful patterns that can guide people toward simple changes in their daily habits to improve their sleep.
